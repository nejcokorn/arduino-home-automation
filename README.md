# Project Objectives
In this home automation project, we aim to address several key concerns often encountered with existing solutions in the market:

**1. Self-management Capability**
- Users should be able to troubleshoot and maintain modules independently. When issues arise, ease of repair or replacement should be a priority.

**2. Cross-Modularity**
- Our solution will seamlessly integrate with various components (e.g., relay modules, input modules, HVAC sensors) regardless of the provider. This flexibility ensures compatibility and accessibility.

**3. Configurability**
- We prioritize an open and user-friendly approach to configuring modules and components. Simplified setup processes enhance usability and adaptability.

**4. Long-Term Support**
- Our system is designed to withstand the test of time, catering to buildings and residences for decades to come. Unlike many market solutions reliant on continuous product support, ours aims for durability and independence from specific providers.

**5. Cloud Optional**
- While cloud-based solutions offer benefits, our system operates efficiently without reliance on cloud infrastructure. This independence safeguards functionality, particularly in scenarios where product providers may cease operations.

**6. Low Technical Knowledge Requirement**
- Our solution is designed to be easily understandable and operable by individuals with varying levels of technical expertise. Intuitive interfaces and straightforward instructions ensure accessibility for most users.

By adhering to these objectives, we aim to create a robust, user-centric home automation solution that prioritizes longevity, flexibility, and ease of use.
